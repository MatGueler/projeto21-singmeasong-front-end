```

Then, inside the folder, run the following command to install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Finished the process, just start the react app

```
npm start
```

<br/>

## :hammer: Testing the application

The tests were carried out on the front-end and abck end of this project. Addressing unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

<br/>

### **Back-end**

To initialize the backend follow the steps described in the following link: [back-end repository](https://github.com/MatGueler/projeto21-singmeasong-back-end)

<br/>

### **Front-end**

In this project, CYPRESS was also used as a front-end test structure, for that, execute the command below to start the automatic tests. It is important to note that to test the front-end it is necessary to have the back-end server running and react initialized. The following commands are for starting end-to-end testing.

- #### e2e (END-TO-END)

In the back folder, run the command below to start the server is required (Following steps in [back-end repository](https://github.com/MatGueler/projeto21-singmeasong-back-end)).

In other command terminal run the comamand bellow to open cypress.

```
npx cypress open
```

Choose E2E testing type, and also choose your preferred browser for E2E testing (preferably electron).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
